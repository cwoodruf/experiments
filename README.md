experiments manager 

This software was used by the SFU Cognitive Sciences lab to manage participants in online, multiplatform experiments. It supports a simple RESTful interface for collecting participant data in real time. 

Its original application was in an experiment that compared learning performance in 2-d (matlab), 3d (Unity) and VR (Unity) environments. The "tools" subdirectory includes software used to enumerate the complex experimental conditions for this experiment. It is intended to be used via web requests or run on the command line for debugging.

The manager software securely manages a limited number of work stations but is intended to be expanded to work with online experiments.
